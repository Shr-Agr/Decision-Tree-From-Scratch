# Implementation of Decision Tree from scratch.

This is the implementation of Decision Tree from scratch (without using any existing library's implementation).

In this implementation ID3 algorithm is used and information gain based on entropy (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression) is used to find the attribute to split about.

k-fold cross validation has also been performed on the tree.
